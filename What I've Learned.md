## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at a full landing page. Whilst relatively simple, the switch from mobile to desktop showed me that there are moments when it is best to stop coding, step away and think through the process. Just writing out the question gives me time to think it through.

There was no major new learning in this process but a solidification of my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Flexbox and Grid.

### Continued development

The main focus will be continue building more complex pages with further layout changes between mobile and desktop.

In addition, I want to bring in some Javascript elements to add to the complexity.
